Project Brief:

The assignment challenged us to create a multi-page tribute website honoring Ozzy Osbourne. The site needed to reflect his iconic persona through bold design choices, accessible navigation, and emotionally resonant content. Key deliverables included semantic HTML structure, responsive styling with Tailwind CSS, branded assets (favicon, footer icons), and a polished user experience across devices.

Website Creation Process:

Planning and Structure:
I began by mapping out the site architecture, identifying core pages (Home, Biography, Discography, Legacy) and how they would interconnect. I focused on creating a logical flow that would guide users through Ozzy’s story with clarity and emotional impact.

Design and Styling:

Using Tailwind CSS, I applied a bold color palette that echoed Ozzy’s dramatic aesthetic. I customized social media icons and footer links to match the site’s tone and ensured that all visual elements supported the narrative.

Coding and Accessibility:

I wrote semantic HTML to ensure screen reader compatibility and used Tailwind’s utility classes to build responsive layouts. I prioritized accessible navigation, readable typography, and consistent spacing.


GitHub Workflow:

This was my first time using GitHub, and it became a cornerstone of my development process. I learned how to:
Create and manage branches for different features
Commit changes with clear messages
Push updates and resolve merge conflicts
Document my work through README files
Version control helped me stay organized and gave me confidence to experiment without fear of losing progress.

Learning Journey:

Everything in this project was new to me — from writing HTML and CSS to using GitHub and Tailwind. I learned:
How to structure content meaningfully
How utility-first CSS can speed up development while maintaining consistency
The importance of accessibility and ethical design
How to troubleshoot layout issues and refactor code for responsiveness

Areas for Improvement:

Logical Structure:
Some pages lacked a clear hierarchy or narrative flow.
Next time, I’ll wireframe the full site before coding to ensure content is logically grouped and user journeys are intuitive.

Layout and Grid Usage:
I relied heavily on flexbox and manual spacing.
Incorporating CSS Grid would allow for more precise control and cleaner alignment, especially for multi-column sections.

Presentation and Communication:
I need to improve how I present my work: clearly explaining the task, process, code decisions, results, and final reflection.
For future assignments, I’ll prepare a short slide deck or annotated walkthrough to support my submission.

Challenges and Solution:
Challenge: Balancing creativity with technical constraints
Solution: Break tasks into smaller chunks and test frequently
Challenge: Understanding GitHub workflows
Solution: Follow tutorials, ask peers, and practice with small commits
Challenge: Styling inconsistencies
Solution: Use design tokens and Tailwind presets to maintain consistency

CSS Best Practices:

Avoid premature styling: Don’t add too much CSS too early — it creates clutter and confusion.
No “magic numbers”: Arbitrary values (e.g., ) are hard to maintain and confuse future developers.
Use meaningful values: Choose spacing and sizing based on design intent, not trial-and-error.
Reduce specificity: Overly specific selectors make overrides difficult. Keep styles modular and predictable.
Avoid dangerous selectors: Using broad tags like  can unintentionally affect multiple elements.
Limit ID usage: IDs should be unique per page. Overusing them breaks accessibility and reusability.
Avoid vague class names: Names like  lack context. Use descriptive, scoped names like  or .

Next Steps:

For the next assignment, I’ll:
Plan the site structure more thoroughly before coding
Use CSS Grid for layout precision
Document my process more clearly
Apply cleaner, scalable CSS practices
Continue refining my GitHub workflow
